Lattice Plotting System

is implemented using following packages:

Lattice: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, independent of "base" graphics system.including xyplot, bwplot, levelplot

grid: lattice package builds on it, we seldome used

Doesnot have a two-phase like base plotting,
all plotting/annotation is done at once with a single function call.

xyplot: main funciton for creating scatterplots
bwplot: box-and-whiskers plots("boxplots")
histogram: histograms
stripplot: like a box plot but with actual points
dotplot: plot dots on "violin strings"
splom: scatterplot matrix; like pairs in base plotting system
levelplot, contourplot: for plotting "image" data

xyplot(y~x|f*g, data)
 f and g are condition variables, the are optional
 
Lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis, and the print methods actually plot 

like
p<-xyplot(Ozone~Wind, data = airquality)
print(p)

Lattice fuctions have a panel function to control what happens inside each panel of the plot(customize)


ggplot2 Plotting System
writtenn by Hadley Wickham, an implementation of Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson
qplot(): like plot() funciton in base graphics system, and looks for data in data frame like lattice, or in parent environment; plots are made up of aesthetics and geoms

factors are importants for indicating subsets of the data, they should be LABELED
ggplot() is the core function and very flexible for doing things qplot() cannot do

### Basic components of ggplot2
# a data frame
# aesthetic mapping: how data mapped to color/size...
# geoms: like points, lines, shapes
# facets: for conditional plots
# stats: statistical transformations like binning, quantiles, smoothing
# sacles: what scale an aesthetic map uses( like: male=red, female = blue)
# coordinate system

#Annotation:
Labels: xlab(), ylab(), labs(), ggtitle()
each of the "geom" functions has options to modify
for things tht only make sense globally, use theme(): example: theme(legend.position="none")
Two standard appearance thesmes are included
 1 theme_gray(): the default theme(gray background)
 2. theme_bw(): more stark/plain
 
 
 
 

### plots are built up in layers
#plot the data/overlay a summary/metadata and annotation
