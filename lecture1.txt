Principles of Analytic Graphics

P1: show comparisons:
  evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
  always ask "compared to what?""
  
P2: show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
  what is our causal framework for thinking about a question
  

P3: show multivariate data
  multivariate = more than 2 variables
  the real world is multivariate
  need to "escape flatland"

example: Simpson's Paradox(each seaon the relationship  is positive bt overall the relationshi appears negative)

P4: integration of evidence
  completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
  data graphics should make ause of many modes of data presentation
  don't let the tool drive the analysis
  
P5:   describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
  a data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
  
P6: content is king
  analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content.
  

Exploratory graphs include first 4 items below:
understand data properties/find patterns in data/suggest modeling strategies/debug asnalysis/communicate results

they are made quickly, 
a large number are made,
the goal is for personal understanding
axes/legends are generally cleaned up(later)
color/size are primarily used for information

simple summaries of data: 
    one dimension data: 
            five-number summary
            boxplots
            histograms
            density plot
            barplot

Two dimensions
    multiple/overlayed 1-D plots(Lattice/ggplot2)
    scatterplots
    smooth scatterplots
    
    
more than 2 dimensions
    Overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots
    use color, size, shape to add dimensions
    spinning plots
    actual 3-D plots(not that useful)
 
 
Summary:
    Exploratory plots are quick and dirty
    let you summarize the data(usually graphicall) and highly any broad  features
    explore basic questions and hypotheses(and perhaps rule them out)
    suggest modeling strategies for the next step
